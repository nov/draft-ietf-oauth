		OAuth provides a method for making authenticated HTTP requests using a token - an
        identifier used to denote an access grant with specific scope, duration, and other
        attributes. Tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the
        approval of the resource owner. OAuth defines multiple flows for obtaining a token to
        support a wide range of client types and user experience.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        With the increasing use of distributed web services and cloud computing, third-party
        applications require access to server-hosted resources. These resources are usually
        private and require authentication using the resource owner's credentials (typically a
        username and password). In the traditional client-server authentication model, a client
        accessing a protected resource on a server presents the resource owner's credentials in
        order to authenticate and gain access.
      </t>
      <t>
        Resource owners should not be required to share their credentials when granting third-party
        applications access to their protected resources. They should also have the ability to
        restrict access to a limited subset of the resources they control, to limit access
        duration, or to limit access to the methods supported by these resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth provides a method for making authenticated HTTP requests using a token - an
        identifier used to denote an access grant with specific scope, duration, and other
        attributes. Tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the
        approval of the resource owner. Instead of sharing their credentials with the client, resource
        owners grant access by authenticating directly with the authorization server which in turn
        issues a token to the client. The client uses the token to authenticate with the resource
        server and gain access.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access to
        her private photos stored at a photo sharing service (resource server), without sharing her
        username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates directly with
        the photo sharing service (authorization server) which issues the printing service
        delegation-specific credentials (token).
      </t>
      <t>
        The use of OAuth with any other transport protocol than <xref target='RFC2616'>HTTP</xref>
        is undefined.

		  Clients interact with a protected resource, first by requesting access (which is granted
		  in the form of an access token) from the authorization server, and then by authenticating
		  with the resource server by presenting the access token. <xref target='Figure 1' />
		  demonstrates the flow between the client and authorization server (A, B), and the flow
		  between the client and resource server (C, D), when the client is acting autonomously
		  (the client is also the resource owner).

		  Access token strings can use any internal structure agreed upon between the authorization
		  server and the resource server, but their structure is opaque to the client. Since the
		  access token provides the client access to the protected resource for the life of the
		  access token, the authorization server should issue access tokens which expire within an
		  appropriate time, usually much shorter than the duration of the access grant.
		</t>
		<t>
	      When an access token expires, the client can request a new access token from the
	      authorization server by presenting its credentials again (<xref target='Figure 1' />), or
	      by using the refresh token (if issued with the access token) as shown in
	      <xref target='Figure 2' />. Once an expired access token has been replaced with a new
	      access token (A, B), the client uses the new access token as before (C, D).

	      This specification defines a number of authorization flows to support different client
	      types and scenarios. These authorization flows can be separated into two groups:
	      autonomous flows where the client is acting for itself (the client is also the resource
	      owner), and user delegation flows where the client is acting on behalf of an end user.
	      Additional authorization flows may be defined by other specifications to cover different
	      scenarios and client types.

			  While the User may use a username and password to authenticate to the

	          username and password to an application (Client) they have installed
	          on their device. The Client presents a Client Identifier, the username
	          and password (credentials) to the Access Token URL at the
	          Authorization Server in exchange for an Access Token and a Refresh
	          Token.

    <section title='Obtaining an Access Token' anchor='get_token'>
      <t>
        The client obtains an access token by using one of the authorization flows supported by the
        authorization server. The authorization flows all use the same authorization endpoint, each
        with a different set of request parameters and values. The client obtains the URI of the
        authorization endpoint from the server's documentation, or by making an unauthorized
        protected resource request (from the <xref target='authn_header'>WWW-Authenticate</xref>
        response header).
      </t>
      <t>
        The authorization endpoint advertised by the server MUST NOT include a query or fragment
        components as defined by <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3.
      </t>
      <t>
        Clients should avoid making assumptions about the size of tokens and other server-generated
        values, which are left undefined by this specification.
      </t>
      <t>
	    [[ Open Issue ]]
	    It is RECOMMENDED that authorization servers make their identifiers, secrets, and tokens
	    string shorter than 255 characters in length in order to ease client implementations.
      </t>
      <t>
	    [[ Open Issue ]]
        All identifiers, secrets, tokens, and codes MUST use URL safe characters and not require
        further encoding. Clients and servers should not make other assumptions about the possible
        range of their values.
      </t>

      <section title='Web Server Flow' anchor='web_profile'>
        <t>
          This flow is suitable when the client is a web application calling the
          protected resource on behalf of a resource owner. It enables clients to act on
          behalf of resource owners without acquiring their credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          Prior to making a request using this flow, the client MUST have obtained a
          client identifier and user authorization request endpoint URI from the
          authorization server. The authorization server MAY require the client to
          pre-register their callback URI.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MUST first send the resource owner's user-agent (commonly his or her
          web browser) to the authorization server's user authorization request endpoint.
          The client constructs the request URI by adding the following REQUIRED query
          parameters to the user authorization endpoint URI:

          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
            <t hangText='mode'>

            <t hangText='client_id'>
	          <vspace />
              The client identifier.

            <t hangText='callback_url'>
	          <vspace />
              An absolute URI to which the authorization server will redirect the
              resource owner back when the resource owner authorization step is
              completed.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MAY also include the following OPTIONAL parameters:

          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
            <t hangText='client_state'>
	          <vspace />
              An opaque value that clients can use to maintain state associated with
              this request.

            <t hangText='scope'>
	          <vspace />
              If the authorization server has defined a manner for the client to
              request certain capabilities of the access token, this parameter SHOULD
              be used to do so.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an HTTP
          redirection response, or by other means available to it via the resource
          owner's user-agent. The request MUST use the HTTP 'GET' method.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the client directs the resource owner's user-agent to make the

          The way in which the server handles the user authorization request (such as via
          cookies), including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS/SSL is beyond
          the scope of this specification. However, the server MUST first verify the
          identity of the resource owner. If the resource owner approves the
          authorization request, the authorization server MUST generate a verification
          code and associate it with the client identifier and callback URI.
        </t>
        <t>
          After receiving an authorization decision from the resource owner, the server
          redirects the resource owner to the callback URI if one was provided in the
          'callback' parameter or pre-registered by other means. The authorization
          server constructs the request URI by adding one of the two following REQUIRED
          parameters to the callback URI query component depending on if the resource
          owner approved (verification_code) or declined (error_reason) the
          authorization request:

        <t>
          If the callback URI already includes a query component as defined by
          <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3, the server MUST append the OAuth
          parameters to the end of the existing query. The callback URI's query component

      <section title='Web Client Flow'>
        <t>
          The Web Client Flow is similar to the <xref target='web_profile'>Web Server Flow</xref>,
          but it has different security characteristics. Client-side applications are
          those that live entirely in JavaScript, on the desktop, on a mobile device,
          or in other environments where the code does not have easy access to a server.
          These applications have the ability to display a web page to the user, but
          cannot receive the response on a server. Because the entirety of the client is
          downloaded to the resource owner's user-agent, it is not possible to completely
          protect the client secret. This flow allows for authorization while taking
          those security considerations into account.
        </t>
        <t>
          Because there is no client secret to ensure authenticity, both the client and
          authorization server should take some extra precautions when using this flow.
          Specifically, as the access token flows directly to the user-agent, it should
          only be used when it is acceptable for the end-user to have direct access to
          the access token. Additionally, care should be taken to choose a good callback
          URL, as described below.
        </t>
        <t>
          Prior to making a request using this flow, the client MUST have obtained a
          client identifier and user authorization request endpoint URI from the
          authorization server. The authorization server SHOULD require the client to
          pre-register their callback URI.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MUST first send the resource owner's user-agent to the authorization
          server's user authorization request endpoint. The client constructs the request
          URI by adding the following REQUIRED query parameters to the user authorization
          endpoint URI:

          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
            <t hangText='mode'>
	          <vspace />
              The parameter value MUST be set to 'flow_web_client' (case sensitive).
            </t>
            <t hangText='client_id'>
	          <vspace />
              The client identifier.
            </t>
            <t hangText='callback_url'>
	          <vspace />
              An absolute URI to which the authorization server will redirect the
              resource owner back when the authorization step is completed. The
              client MUST make use of at least one of either a transport-layer
              mechanism such as TLS or SSL (or a secure channel with equivalent
              protections) for the callback URI or including a fragment identifier
              ('#') as defined by <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3.5 in the URI to
              prevent transmission of plain text credentials.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MAY also include the following OPTIONAL parameters:

          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
            <t hangText='client_state'>
	          <vspace />
              An opaque value that clients can use to maintain state associated with
              this request.
            </t>
            <t hangText='scope'>
	          <vspace />
              If the authorization server has defined a manner for the client to
              request certain capabilities of the access token, this parameter SHOULD
              be used to do so.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an HTTP
          redirection response, or by other means available to it via the resource
          owner's user-agent. The request MUST use the HTTP 'GET' method.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the client directs the resource owner's user-agent to make one
            of the following HTTPS requests (line breaks are for display purposes only):

        <t>
          The way in which the server handles the user authorization request (such as via
          cookies), including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS/SSL is beyond
          the scope of this specification. However, the server MUST first verify the
          identity of the resource owner.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the Client has previously registered a callback URI with the authorization
          server, it MUST verify that the callback URI provided in the 'callback'
          parameter is valid given the pre-registered URI.
        </t>
        <t>
          After receiving an authorization decision from the resource owner, the server
          redirects the resource owner to the callback URI. The authorization server
          constructs the request URI by adding the following REQUIRED parameter to the
          callback URI query component:

          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
            <t hangText='access_token'>
	          <vspace />
              The access token.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MAY also include the following parameters:

          <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
            <t hangText='expires'>
	          <vspace />
              The lifetime of the access token in seconds.
            </t>
            <t hangText='refresh_token'>
	          <vspace />
              The refresh token.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          If the callback URI already includes a query component as defined by
          <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3, the server MUST append the OAuth
          parameters to the end of the existing query. If the callback URI includes a
          fragment (#), then the OAuth parameters MUST be appended to the end of the
          query, after the fragment. The callback URI's query component MUST NOT contain
          any parameters beginning with the '' prefix.

          The client MUST display the user verification URL and the user verification

          The way in which the authorization server handles the user authorization
          request, including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS/SSL is beyond
          the scope of this specification. However, the server MUST first verify the
          identity of the resource owner. After doing so, the server MUST prompt the
          end-user to enter the user verification code.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST verify that the user verification code is valid
          and MAY verify that the client is authorized to use this flow. If the request
          is authorized, the authorization server directs the end-user to go back to the
          client device and follow its instructions.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MAY have an interface element (such as a button) that the end-user
          interacts with to communicate that they have finished the authorization
          process. The client MAY initiate the following request at an arbitrary but
          reasonable interval in order to create a more responsive user experience though
          MUST NOT exceed the verification rate limit if one is specified. The client
          MUST either poll or have an interface element, or both.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client constructs an HTTP 'GET' request to the access token request

      <section title='Username and Password Flow'>
        <t>
          This flow is used when the authorization server generally trusts the client to
          temporarily collect the end-user's username and password and it is impossible
          to use one of the other authorization flows. This flow enables a client to act
          on behalf of the resource owner without having to permanently store their
          username and password. This flow also enables clients who previously used
          username and password to perform a conversion to token based credentials.
        </t>
        <t>
          Prior to making a request using this flow, the client MUST have obtained a
          client identifier and access token request endpoint URI from the authorization
          server. How the client prompts the resource owner for their username and
          password is beyond the scope of this specification. The client must discard the
          resource owner's username and password once an access token has been obtained.
        </t>
        <t>
          Because the end-user's username and password flows through the client, it is
          RECOMMENDED that authorization servers only allow 'trusted' clients to have
          access to this flow; it is RECOMMENDED that, by default, a client does not have
          access to this flow, and it must have its abilities elevated somehow. In the
          case of allowing a client to convert usernames and passwords to tokens, it is
          RECOMMENDED that a client only be given access to this flow for a set time
          duration. The method by which to elevate permissions is out of scope for this
          document.
        </t>

        <t>
	      Authorization servers SHOULD issue access tokens with a limited lifetime and require

    <section title='Refreshing an Access Token' anchor='refresh_token'>
      <t>
        Authorization servers MAY issue access tokens that expire and thus require clients to
        refresh them. A client determines that an access token needs refreshing either by using the
        access token's expiration information or upon receiving the HTTP 401 Unauthorized response
        when accessing protected resources per <xref target='access_resource' />. A client will
        also refresh a token if it wishes to obtain a corresponding access token secret for use
        when accessing protected resources via signatures (<xref target='using_signatures'/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        Prior to making a request using this flow, the client MUST have obtained a client
        identifier, client secret, and access token request endpoint URI from the
        authorization server.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client constructs an HTTP 'POST' request to the access token request endpoint and
        includes the following REQUIRED parameters:

        <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
          <t hangText='mode'>
	        <vspace />
            The parameter value MUST be set to 'refresh_token' (case sensitive).
          </t>
          <t hangText='client_id'>
	        <vspace />
            The client identifier.
          </t>
          <t hangText='refresh_token'>
	        <vspace />
            The refresh token associated with the access token to be refreshed.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        If the client has access to the client secret, the following parameter SHOULD also be added
        to the request:

        <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
          <t hangText='client_secret'>
	        <vspace />
            The client secret.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        If the client wishes to obtain an access token for use when accessing protected resources
        via signatures, the following parameters MUST also be added to the request:

        <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
          <t hangText='want_secret'>
	        <vspace />
            The parameter value MUST be set to 'true' (case sensitive).
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Since the request results in the transmission of plain text credentials in both the HTTP
        request and response, the authorization server MUST require the use of a transport-layer
        mechanism such as TLS or SSL (or a secure channel with equivalent protections).
      </t>
      <figure>
        <preamble>
          For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request:

        </artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        The authorization server MUST verify that the resource owner has still authorized the
        provisioning of an access token to the client and that the refresh token is valid. If the
        request is authorized, the access token is included in the HTTP response body using the
        'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' content type as defined by
        <xref target='W3C.REC-html40-19980424' /> with a 200 status code (OK).
      </t>
      <t>
        If an access token secret is included in the response, the protected resource MUST NOT
        allow the use of the corresponding access token without its secret
        (<xref target='using_ssl' />).

    <section title='Accessing a Protected Resource' anchor='access_resource'>
      <t>
        OAuth 2.0 supports the ability for clients to make protected resource requests by using
        TLS/SSL (<xref target='using_ssl' />) and/or by signing their HTTP request with shared
        secrets (<xref target='using_signatures' />). Protected resources MUST support clients
        making authenticated requests via TLS/SSL (<xref target='using_ssl' />). Protected
        resources MAY also choose to also support signatures (<xref target='using_signatures' />),
        and it is RECOMMENDED that clients make signature-based authenticated requests via TLS/SSL.
      </t>
      <t>
        If a client includes more than one access token within the request, the protected resource
        MUST respond with a HTTP 400 'Bad Request' error code.
      </t>

      <section title='Bearer Token Requests' anchor='using_ssl'>
        <t>
          When using TLS/SSL, clients MUST present an access token to authenticate to a protected
          resource. Use of the HTTP 'Authorization' header field as defined by
          <xref target='RFC2617' /> is RECOMMENDED, since HTTP implementations are aware that this
          header has special security properties and may require special treatment in caches and
          logs. Protected resources SHOULD take precautions to ensure that access tokens are not
          inadvertently logged or captured. It is RECOMMENDED that clients verify the authenticity
          of the certificate provided when establishing a TLS/SSL connection to the protected
          resource.
        </t>

        <section title='HTTP Header'>
          <t>
            The protected resource SHOULD allow clients to make authenticated requests by including
            the access token in the HTTP 'Authorization' header. Prior to making a request, the
            client MUST have obtained a valid access token and the API request endpoint URI.
          </t>
          <t>
            The client constructs a HTTP request to the API request endpoint URI and includes the
            HTTP 'Authorization' header field with the auth-scheme name set to 'OAuth'
            (case-insensitive).
          </t>
          <t>
            Since the request results in the transmission of plain text credentials in the HTTP

        <section title='Computing the signature' anchor='compute_sig'>
          <t>
            The authorization server declares which signature methods it accepts via the
            'signature_methods' returned as part of obtaining an access token secret
            (<xref target='refresh_token' />). The client declares which signature method is used
            for this request via the 'signature_method' parameter. It then generates a
            signature, and includes it in the 'signature' parameter. The server verifies the
            signature as specified for each method.
          </t>
          <t>
            There is no mandate for a particular signature method as each implementation can have
            its own unique requirements. Authorization servers are free to implement and document
            their own custom methods.
          </t>

          <section title='HMAC-SHA1'>
            <t>
              The 'HMAC-SHA1' signature method uses the HMAC-SHA1 signature algorithm as defined in
              <xref target='RFC2104' />:

              <list>
                <t>
                  digest = HMAC-SHA1 (key, text)
                </t>
              </list>
            </t>
            <t>
              The HMAC-SHA1 function variables are used in following way:

              <list style='hanging' hangIndent='6'>
                <t hangText='text'>
                  is set to the value of the signature base string.
                </t>
                <t hangText='key'>
                  is set to the access token secret.
                </t>
                <t hangText='digest'>
                  is used to set the value of the 'signature' protocol parameter, after the
                  result octet string is base64-encoded per section 6.8 of <xref target='RFC2045' />.
                </t>

        <section title='Client Calls Protected Resource Using HTTP Headers' anchor='sig_headers'>
          <t>
            The protected resource MAY allow clients to make authenticated requests by including
            the access token in the HTTP 'Authorization' header. Prior to making a request, the
            client MUST have obtained a valid access token, a valid access token secret, and the
            API request endpoint URI. It MUST have also constructed the signature base string and
            <xref target='compute_sig'>computed the signature</xref>.
          </t>
          <t>
            The client constructs a HTTP request to the API request endpoint URI and includes the
            HTTP 'Authorization' header field with the auth-scheme name set to 'OAuth'
            (case-insensitive). The protocol parameters and the signature computed in
            <xref target='compute_sig' /> are included in the Authorization header.

        <t>
          Signature-based and hash-based authentication methods use timestamps in combination with

        </t>
        <t>
          The timestamp attribute is used by the server to publish its current time, enabling
          clients to synchronize their close with the server. The timestamp value is the current
          time expressed in the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT, and MUST be a
          positive integer.

          To avoid the need to retain an infinite number of nonce values for future checks, servers
          MAY choose to restrict the time period after which a request with an old timestamp is
          rejected. Servers applying such a restriction SHOULD provide their current time to the
          client either in every challenge or when a request fails due to a timestamp outside the
