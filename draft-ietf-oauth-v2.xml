        The OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol enables granting third-party applications limited
        access to HTTP service on behalf of an end-user by orchestrating an approval interaction
        between the end-user and the HTTP service.

    <section title='Introduction'>
      <t>
        In the traditional client-server authentication model, the client accesses a protected
        resource on the server by authenticating with the server using the resource owner's
        credentials. In order to provide third-party applications access to protected resources,
        the resource owner shares its credentials with the third-party. This creates several
        problems and limitations:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Third-party applications are required to store the resource-owner's credentials
            for future use, typically a password in clear-text.
          </t>
          <t>
            Servers are required to support password authentication, despite the security
            weaknesses created by passwords.
          </t>
          <t>
            Third-party applications gain overly broad access to the resource-owner's protected
            resources, leaving resource owners without any ability to restrict duration or access
            to a limited subset of resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            Resource owners cannot revoke access to an individual third-party without revoking
            access to all third-parties, and must do so by changing their password.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        OAuth addresses these issues by introducing an authorization layer and separating the role
        of the client from that of the resource owner. In OAuth, the client requests access to
        resources controlled by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is issued
        a different set of credentials than those of the resource owner.
      </t>
      <t>
        Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources, the client
        obtains an access token - a string denoting a specific scope, duration, and other access
        attributes. Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with
        the approval of the resource owner. The client uses the access token to access the
        protected resources hosted by the resource server.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a web end-user (resource owner) can grant a printing service (client) access
        to her protected photos stored at a photo sharing service (resource server), without
        sharing her username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates
        directly with a server trusted by the photo sharing service (authorization server) which
        issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials (access token).
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification is designed for use with HTTP <xref target='RFC2616' />. The use of
        OAuth with any transport protocol other than HTTP is undefined.
      </t>

      <section title='Roles'>
        <t>
          OAuth includes four roles working together to grant and provide access to protected
          resources - access restricted resources which require authentication to access:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText='resource owner'>
              <vspace />
              An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner
              is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.
            </t>
            <t hangText='resource server'>
              <vspace />
              The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to
              protected resource requests using access tokens.
            </t>
            <t hangText='client'>
              <vspace />
              An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and
              with its authorization.
            </t>
            <t hangText='authorization server'>
              <vspace />
              The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the
              resource owner and obtaining authorization.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The interaction between the authorization server and resource server is beyond the scope
          of this specification. The authorization server may be the same server as the resource
          server or a separate entity. A single authorization server may issue access tokens
          accepted by multiple resource servers.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title='Protocol Flow'>
        <t>
          When interacting with the authorization server, the client identifies itself using a set
          of client credentials which include a client identifier and other authentication
          attributes. The means through which the client obtains its credentials are beyond the
          scope of this specification, but typically involve registration with the authorization
          server.

        <t>
          The abstract flow illustrated in <xref target='Figure 1' /> describes the interaction
          between the four roles and includes the following steps:
        </t>
        <t>
          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The authorization request
              can be made directly to the resource owner (as shown), or preferably indirectly via
              an intermediary such as an authorization server.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client receives an authorization grant which represents the authorization
              provided by the resource owner. The authorization grant type depends on the method used by
              the client and supported by the authorization server to obtain it.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server
              using its client credentials (prearranged between the client and authorization
              server) and presenting the authorization grant.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server validates the client credentials and the authorization grant, and
              if valid issues an access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests the protected resource from the resource server and authenticates
              by presenting the access token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Access Token'>
        <t>
          An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client. The
          string is usually opaque to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of
          access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and
          authorization server.
        </t>
        <t>
          The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the authorization information, or
          self-contain the authorization information in a verifiable manner (i.e. a token string
          consisting of some data and a signature). Additional authentication credentials may be
          required in order for the client to use a token.
        </t>
        <t>
          The access token provides an abstraction layer, replacing different authorization
          constructs (e.g. username and password) with a single token understood by the resource
          server. This abstraction enables issuing access tokens more restrictive than the
          authorization grant used to obtain them, as well as removing the resource server's need to
          understand a wide range of authentication methods.
        </t>
        <t>
          Access tokens can have different formats, structures, and methods of utilization (e.g.
          cryptographic properties) based on the resource server security requirements. Access token
          attributes and the methods used to access protected resources are beyond the scope of this
          specification and are defined by companion specifications.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title='Authorization Grant'>
        <t>
          An authorization grant is a general term used to describe the intermediate credentials
          representing the resource owner authorization (to access its protected resources), and
          serves as an abstraction layer. An authorization grant is used by the client to obtain
          an access token.
        </t>
        <t>
          This specification defines four grant types: authorization code, implicit, resource owner
          password credentials, and client credentials, as well as an extensibility mechanism for
          defining additional types.
        </t>

        <section title='Authorization Code'>
          <t>
            The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary
            between the client and resource owner. Instead of requesting authorization directly
            from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization
            server (via its user-agent as defined in <xref target='RFC2616' />), which in turns
            directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.
          </t>
          <t>
            Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code, the
            authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains authorization.
            Because the resource owner only authenticates with the authorization server, the
            resource owner's credentials are never shared with the client.
          </t>
          <t>
            The authorization code provides a few important security benefits such as the ability to
            authenticate the client and issuing the access token directly to the client without
            potentially exposing it to others, including the resource owner.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Implicit'>
          <t>
            When an access token is issued to the client directly as the result of the resource
            owner authorization, without an intermediary authorization grant (such as an
            authorization code), the grant is considered implicit.
          </t>
          <t>
            When issuing an implicit grant, the authorization server cannot verify the identity of
            the client, and the access token may be exposed to the resource owner or other
            applications with access to the resource owner's user-agent.
          </t>
          <t>
            Implicit grants improve the responsiveness and efficiency of some clients (such as a
            client implemented as an in-browser application) since it reduces the number of round
            trips required to obtain an access token.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Resource Owner Password Credentials">
          <t>
            The resource owner password credentials (e.g. a username and password) can be used
            directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token. The credentials should
            only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the
            client (e.g. its computer operating system or a highly privileged application), and
            when other authorization grant types are not available (such as an authorization code).
          </t>
          <t>
            Even though this grant type requires direct client access to the resource owner
            credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for a single request and are
            exchanged for an access token. Unlike the HTTP Basic authentication scheme defined in
            <xref target='RFC2617' />, this grant type (when combined with a refresh token)
            eliminates the need for the client to store the resource-owner credentials for future
            use.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Client Credentials'>
          <t>
            The client credentials can be used as an authorization grant when the authorization
            scope is limited to the protected resources under the control of the client, or to
            protected resources previously arranged with the authorization server. Client
            credentials are used as an authorization grant typically when the client is acting on
            its own behalf (the client is also the resource owner).
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title='Extensions'>
          <t>
            Additional grant types may be defined to provide a bridge between OAuth and other
            protocols. For example, <xref target='I-D.ietf-oauth-saml2-bearer' /> defines a
            <xref target='OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os'>SAML 2.0</xref> bearer assertion grant type,
            which can be used to obtain an access token.
          </t>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section title='Refresh Token'>
        <t>
          A refresh token is optionally issued by the authorization server to the client together
          with an access token. The client can use the refresh token to request another access
          token based on the same authorization, without having to involve the resource owner
          again, or having to retain the original authorization grant used to obtain the initial
          access token.
        </t>
        <t>
          A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client by the
          resource owner. The string is usually opaque to the client. The token may denote an
          identifier used to retrieve the authorization information, or self-contain the
          authorization information in a verifiable manner. The refresh token is bound to the
          client it was issued to, and its usage requires client authentication.
        </t>
        <t>
          The refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token when the current access token
          expires (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime than authorized by the resource
          owner), no longer valid, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower
          scope.

            <t>
              Steps (C) and (D) repeat until the access token expires. If the client knows the
              access token expired, it skips to step (G), otherwise it makes another protected
              resource request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Since the access token is invalid, the resource server returns an invalid token
              error.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests a new access token by authenticating with the authorization
              server using its client credentials, and presenting the refresh token.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server validates the client credentials and the refresh token,
              and if valid issues a new access token (and optionally, a new refresh token).

    <section title='Protocol Endpoints'>
      <t>
        The authorization process utilizes two endpoints (HTTP resources):
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            Authorization endpoint - used to obtain authorization from the resource owner via
            user-agent redirection.
          </t>
          <t>
            Token endpoint - used to exchange an authorization grant for an access token, typically
            with client authentication.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Not every authorization grant type utilizes both endpoints. Extension grant types MAY
        define additional endpoints as needed.
      </t>

      <section title='Authorization Endpoint'>
        <t>
          The authorization endpoint is used to interact with the resource owner and obtain
          authorization which is expressed explicitly as an authorization code (exchanged for an
          access token), or implicitly by direct issuance of an access token.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner. The way in
          which the authorization server authenticates the resource owner (e.g. username and
          password login, session cookies) is beyond the scope of this specification.
        </t>
        <t>
          The means through which the client obtains the location of the authorization endpoint are
          beyond the scope of this specification but is typically provided in the service
          documentation. The endpoint URI MAY include a query component as defined by
          <xref target='RFC3986' /> section 3, which MUST be retained when adding additional query
          parameters.
        </t>
        <t>
          Requests to the authorization endpoint result in resource owner authentication and the
          transmission of sensitive information. If the response includes an access token, the
          authorization server MUST require TLS 1.2 as defined in <xref target='RFC5246' /> and MAY
          support additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security requirements. If the
          response does not include an access token, the authorization server SHOULD require TLS
          1.2 and any additional transport-layer mechanism meeting its security requirements.
        </t>
        <t>
          The authorization server MUST support the use of the HTTP <spanx style='verb'>GET</spanx>
          method <xref target='RFC2616' /> for the authorization endpoint, and MAY support the use
          of the <spanx style='verb'>POST</spanx> method as well.
        </t>
        <t>
          The REQUIRED <spanx style='verb'>response_type</spanx> request parameter is used to
          identify which grant type the client is requesting: authorization code or implicit,
          described in <xref target='code_authz_req' /> and <xref target='implicit_authz_req' />
          respectively. If the request is missing the <spanx style='verb'>response_type</spanx>
          parameter, the authorization server SHOULD return an error response as described in
          <xref target='code_authz_error' />.
        </t>
        <t>
          Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were omitted from the
          request. The authorization server SHOULD ignore unrecognized request parameters.
        </t>
        <t>
          Request and response parameters MUST NOT repeat more than once, unless noted otherwise.
        </t>

        <section title='Redirection URI' anchor='redirect_uri'>
          <t>
            The client directs the resource owner's user-agent to the authorization endpoint and
            includes a redirection URI to which the authorization server will redirect the
            user-agent back once authorization has been obtained (or denied). The client MAY omit
            the redirection URI if one has been established between the client and authorization
            server via other means, such as during the client registration process.
          </t>
          <t>
            The redirection URI MUST be an absolute URI and MAY include a query component, which
            MUST be retained by the authorization server when adding additional query parameters.
          </t>
          <t>
            The authorization server SHOULD require the client to pre-register their redirection
            URI or at least certain components such as the scheme, host, port and path. If a
            redirection URI was registered, the authorization server MUST compare any redirection
            URI received at the authorization endpoint with the registered URI.
          </t>
          <t>
            The authorization server SHOULD NOT redirect the user-agent to unregistered or
            untrusted URIs to prevent the endpoint from being used as an open redirector. If no
            valid redirection URI is available, the authorization server SHOULD inform the
            resource owner directly of the error.
          </t>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section title='Token Endpoint'>
        <t>
          The token endpoint is used by the client to obtain an access token by authenticating with
          the authorization server and presenting its authorization grant or refresh token. The
          token endpoint is used with every authorization grant except for the implicit grant type
          (since an access token is issued directly).
        </t>
        <t>
          The means through which the client obtains the location of the token endpoint are
          beyond the scope of this specification but is typically provided in the service
          documentation. The endpoint URI MAY include a query component, which MUST be retained
          when adding additional query parameters.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since requests to the token endpoint result in the transmission of clear-text credentials
          (in the HTTP request and response), the authorization server MUST require the use of a
          transport-layer security mechanism when sending requests to the token endpoints. The
          authorization server MUST support TLS 1.2 as defined in <xref target='RFC5246' />, and
          MAY support additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security requirements.
        </t>
        <t>
          The token endpoint requires client authentication as described in
          <xref target='client-authentication' />. The authorization server MAY accept any form of
          client authentication meeting its security requirements. The client MUST NOT use more
          than one authentication method in each request.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MUST use the HTTP <spanx style='verb'>POST</spanx> method when making access
          token requests.
        </t>
        <t>
          Parameters sent without a value MUST be treated as if they were omitted from the
          request. The authorization server SHOULD ignore unrecognized request parameters.
        </t>
        <t>
          Request and response parameters MUST NOT repeat more than once, unless noted otherwise.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title='Client Authentication' anchor='client-authentication'>
      <t>
        Client credentials are used to identify and authenticate the client. The client
        credentials include a client identifier - a unique string issued to the client to
        identify itself to the authorization server. The client identifier is not a secret, it is
        exposed to the resource owner, and MUST NOT be used alone for client authentication. Client
        authentication is accomplished via additional means such as a matching client password.
      </t>
      <t>
        The methods through which the client obtains its client credentials are beyond the scope of
        this specification. However, the client registration process typically includes gathering
        relevant information used to inform the resource owner about the client when requesting
        authorization.
      </t>
      <t>
        Due to the nature of some clients, the authorization server should not make assumptions
        about the confidentiality of client credentials without establishing trust with the
        client. The authorization server SHOULD NOT issue client credentials to clients incapable
        of keeping their credentials confidential.
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition, the authorization server MAY allow unauthenticated access token requests
        when the client identity does not matter (e.g. anonymous client) or when the client
        identity is established via other means. For readability purposes only, this specification
        is written under the assumption that the authorization server requires some form of client
        authentication. However, such language does not affect the authorization server's discretion
        in allowing unauthenticated client requests.
      </t>

      <section title='Client Password Authentication'>
        <t>
          The client password authentication uses a shared symmetric secret to authenticate the
          client. The client identifier and password are included in the request using the
          following parameters:
        </t>
        <t>

      <section title='Other Client Authentication Methods'>
        <t>
          In cases where client password authentication is not suitable or sufficient, the
          authorization server MAY support other existing HTTP authentication schemes or define
          new methods.
        </t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>
            For example, the authorization server MAY support using the HTTP Basic
            authentication scheme as defined in <xref target='RFC2617' /> to include the client
            identifier as the username and client password as the password (line breaks are for
            display purposes only):

        <t>
          When using a method other than client password authentication to exchange an
          authorization code grant type, the authorization server MUST define a method for
          mapping the client credentials to the client identifier used to obtain the
          authorization code.
        </t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title='Obtaining Authorization'>
      <t>
        To request an access token, the client obtains authorization from the resource owner. The
        authorization is expressed in the form of an authorization grant which the client uses to
        request the access token. OAuth defines four grant types: authorization code, implicit,
        resource owner password credentials, and client credentials. It also provides an extension
        mechanism for defining additional grant types.
      </t>

      <section title='Authorization Code'>
        <t>
          The authorization code grant type is suitable for clients capable of maintaining their
          client credentials confidential (for authenticating with the authorization server) such
          as a client implemented on a secure server. As a redirection-based flow, the client
          must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
          browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the
          authorization server.

        <t>
          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's user-agent to the
              authorization endpoint. The client includes its client identifier, requested
              scope, local state, and a redirection URI to which the authorization server will send
              the user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via the user-agent) and
              establishes whether the resource owner grants or denies the client's access request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization server redirects the
              user-agent back to the client using the redirection URI provided earlier. The
              redirection URI includes an authorization code and any local state provided by the
              client earlier.
            </t>
            <t>
              The client requests an access token from the authorization server's token endpoint
              by authenticating using its client credentials, and includes the authorization code
              received in the previous step. The client includes the redirection URI used to obtain
              the authorization code for verification.
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server validates the client credentials, the authorization code,

      <section title='Implicit Grant'>
        <t>
          The implicit grant type is suitable for clients incapable of maintaining their
          client credentials confidential (for authenticating with the authorization server) such
          as client applications residing in a user-agent, typically implemented in a browser using
          a scripting language such as JavaScript.
        </t>
        <t>
          As a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the
          resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming
          requests (via redirection) from the authorization server.
        </t>
        <t>
          Unlike the authorization code grant type in which the client makes separate requests for
          authorization and access token, the client receives the access token as the result of the
          authorization request.
        </t>
        <t>
          Using the implicit grant type does not include client authentication since the client is
          unable to maintain their credential confidentiality (the client resides on the resource
          owner's computer or device which makes the client credentials accessible and
          exploitable). Because the access token is encoded into the redirection URI, it may be
          exposed to the resource owner and other applications residing on its computer or device.

        <t>
          <list style='format (%C)'>
            <t>
              The client initiates the flow by directing the resource owner's user-agent to the
              authorization endpoint. The client includes its client identifier, requested
              scope, local state, and a redirection URI to which the authorization server will send
              the user-agent back once access is granted (or denied).
            </t>
            <t>
              The authorization server authenticates the resource owner (via the user-agent) and
              establishes whether the resource owner grants or denies the client's access request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Assuming the resource owner grants access, the authorization server redirects the
              user-agent back to the client using the redirection URI provided earlier. The
              redirection URI includes the access token in the URI fragment.
            </t>
            <t>
              The user-agent follows the redirection instructions by making a request to the web
              server (does not include the fragment). The user-agent retains the fragment
              information locally.
            </t>
            <t>
              The web server returns a web page (typically an HTML document with an embedded
              script) capable of accessing the full redirection URI including the fragment retained
              by the user-agent, and extracting the access token (and other parameters) contained
              in the fragment.
            </t>
            <t>
              The user-agent executes the script provided by the web server locally, which
              extracts the access token and passes it to the client.

          The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in cases where the
          resource owner has a trust relationship with the client, such as its computer operating
          system or a highly privileged application. The authorization server should take special
          care when enabling the grant type, and only when other flows are not viable.
        </t>
        <t>
          The grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the resource owner credentials
          (username and password, typically using an interactive form). It is also used to migrate
          existing clients using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
          authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials with an access token.

          Access token types are registered on the advice of one or more Designated Experts
          (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a Specification Required (using
          terminology from <xref target='RFC5226' />). However, to allow for the allocation of

          are satisfied that such a specification will be published.
        </t>
        <t>
          Registration requests should be sent to the [TBD]@ietf.org mailing list for review and
          comment, with an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request for access toke type: example").
          [[ Note to RFC-EDITOR: The name of the mailing list should be determined in consultation

          Within at most 14 days of the request, the Designated Expert(s) will either approve or
          deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the review list and IANA.
          Denials should include an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make
          the request successful.
        </t>
        <t>
          Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be first appealed to
          Application Area Directors (contactable using app-ads@tools.ietf.org email address or
          directly by looking up their email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) and, if the
